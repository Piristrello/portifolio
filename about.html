                Hello, my name is Leonardo Piristrello Alexandre and I am 18 years old. I am from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, where I currently work as a 
                Prospecting Analyst at Finnet, an innovative technology company. My professional journey is aligned with my passion for technology and development,
                 which is also reflected in my academic life.
                 I am in the second semester of the Computer Science course at Unicid, and I am excited about the possibilities that this area offers.
            </p>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">
                In addition to my work and studies, I have a clear goal for the future:
                to become a Full stack developer
                . I'm constantly improving my skills and knowledge to create amazing and
                functional web experiences. I believe that the combination of my hands-on experience at Finnet and my academic background at Unicid will prepare me well to achieve this goal and contribute meaningfully to the world of technology.
